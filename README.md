> - and other supporting libraries

### 4. Set Your Environment Variables

Set your API key for OpenAI before running the app:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here   # On Windows: set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

## ðŸ§± Architecture

```
+-------------+        +----------------+        +-----------------+
|  User Input | -----> | Web Retriever  | -----> |     LLM (GPT)   |
+-------------+        +----------------+        +-----------------+
                                                |
                                        +-------v--------+
                                        | Final Response |
                                        +----------------+
```

- **Web Retriever**: Uses `duckduckgo_search` to fetch contextual snippets.
- **LLM Interface**: Calls GPT or another model with the query and context.
- **CLI Interface**: Prints the answer in the terminal.
